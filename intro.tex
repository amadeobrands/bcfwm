Research in spam-prevention let to a mechanism called ``proof of work''.
Such proofs are \emph{easy to verify} (algorithmically) but \emph{hard, yet feasible, to construct}.

A ``transaction log'' is a way to record alterations to a database.

Bitcoin is a system that combines such a transaction log with proof of work
to build a fully decentralised database.

The log is used to construct the state of the database and it can only be
modified by recomputing the Proof of Work.

% Faced with global issues such as [...] there is an even stronger need for
% anthropogenic climate change,
%corrupted power structures, inefficient and discriminating supply chains,
%exclusive and malincentivised (financial) markets, layers of middleman
%adding no value.

``It seemed so obvious to me; here we are faced with the problems of
loss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more
centralization -- and Chaum offers a completely different direction to go in, one which puts power into the hands of individuals rather than governments and corporations. The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.''}
