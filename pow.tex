\subsection{Proof of Work}
\label{PoW}

PoW, pioneered by Bitcoin, uses the fact the $H$ is not efficiently invertible to provide a mechanism of proof that one has done a certain amount of computational work.

We introduce a parameter called \emph{difficulty} which is a number $0 < k < m$.

Let $A;B$ denote concatenation of bitstrings.

For a given bitstring $X$, a \emph{proof of work at difficulty $k$},
is a bitstring (or number) $N$ called a \emph{nonce},
such that $H(X;N)$ is a bitstring starting with $k$ \texttt{0}-bits.

The reasoning is that the only way to find such $N$ is to simply try them then all until one finds that $H(X;N)$ starts with $k$ zeros.

If $k=1$ there is a 50 percent chance the first bit is zero of every possible nonce.
When $k=2$ it is is 25 percent chance the first two bits are zero, etc.
